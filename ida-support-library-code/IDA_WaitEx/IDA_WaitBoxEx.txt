
IDA WaitBoxEx:
Version 1.5, April 2018
By Sirmabus
A full featured IDA Pro wait box replacement with progress bar and
customization options.

Features:
1) A "determinate" or "indeterminate" progress bar.
2) A minimize button.
3) Facilitates Qt CSS style sheets application for customization.
   Here one can change colors, the font, positions, labels, add texture, etc.
4) Facilitates the changing of the titlebar icon for yet more customization.
5) A Windows 7 style taskbar progress indicator.
6) Low cancel-check overhead using the isUpdateTime() method.

Fixes:
1) Fixes the IDA wait box and main window freeze/stall/hangup issue.
2) Wait box works as a direct child of the main window; avoiding the odd separate
window you see when you tab/switched the default one.
3) Working "Cancel" button that instantly responds to user input.
4) The close 'X' button is enabled, acting as an alternate "Cancel" button.

It's pretty much the same useage as the deault IDA "show_wait_box()".
Example:
#include "WaitBoxEx.h"

WaitBox::show();
do
{
        // Check if canceled and update progress
        if (WaitBox::isUpdateTime())
                if (WaitBox::updateAndCancelCheck(progressPercent))
            break;

        ...
        ...
}
while(I'm doing something);
WaitBox::hide();

See the "Plugin Example" project.
You do NOT need to have Qt installed to use it.
But you'll need it if you want to make modifications.
